    "\n",
    "1.  **Trailing Commas**: If you are only evaluating **one** model, you must keep a trailing comma so Python recognizes it as a tuple:\n",
    "    * `model_list = (\"IFS\",)` $\\leftarrow$ Correct\n",
    "    * `model_list = (\"IFS\")` $\\leftarrow$ **Incorrect** (Python will treat this as a simple string)\n",
    "2.  **Consistency**: The number of entries in `model_list` must exactly match the number of entries in the subsequent `_list` parameters (like `model_dir_list` and `model_var_list`).\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Why use a Reference Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark allows you to calculate \"Skill Scores.\" Instead of just knowing if your model is accurate, you learn if it is *better* than a simple baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Climatology**: If `ref_model = \"climatology\"`, the system typically compares results against the long-term mean of the observation data.\n",
    "* **Persistence**: You might use a previous day/year as a reference to see if the model adds value beyond simply repeating the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Configuration Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Shared Directories**: It is common for `ref_model_dir` to be the same as `obs_dir` if you are using historical observational data as your climatology baseline.\n",
    "2.  **Consistency**: Ensure `ref_model_var` and `ref_model_unit_cvt` result in the same physical units as your observation and forecast data. If the units don't match, the error metrics (like RMSE or Bias) will be mathematically invalid.\n",
    "3.  **File Pattern**: Like the observation section, the `{}` placeholder ensures the script can iterate through multiple years of benchmark data automatically."

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling Multiple Models - understanding the mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of this section lies in its **parallel structure**. Each item in the first list corresponds to the same index in the other lists. The system matches these parameters by their **index** (their position in the tuple).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "* **Model 1 (IFS):** Uses variable `tp`, stored in `data/ifs`.\n",
    "* **Model 2 (NGCM):** Also uses variable `tp`, stored in `data/ngcm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Mapping:**\n",
    "* **Index 0**: `model_dir_list[0]` $\\rightarrow$ `model_var_list[0]` $\\rightarrow$ `unit_cvt_list[0]`\n",
    "* **Index 1**: `model_dir_list[1]` $\\rightarrow$ `model_var_list[1]` $\\rightarrow$ `unit_cvt_list[1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations & Potential Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Index Mismatch**: If `model_dir_list` has 3 paths but `model_var_list` only has 2 names, the notebook will crash with an `IndexError`. **Always ensure all lists have the same length.**\n",
    "2.  **Variable Variations**: Note that while the variable name is often the same (e.g., `\"tp\"`), different centers (ECMWF vs. NCEP) might use different default units.\n",
    "    * *Tip:* Check if one model is in **meters** (requires `unit_cvt = 1000`) and the other is already in **mm** (requires `None`).\n",
    "3.  **File Naming**: If Model A uses `YYYY.nc` but Model B uses `model_YYYY.nc`, you must reflect this in the `file_pattern_list` using `(\"{}.nc\", \"model_{}.nc\")`.\n",
    "4.  **Immutability**: Since these are defined as **Tuples** (using parentheses `()`), they cannot be changed globally once the script starts running. If you need to add a model dynamically during a session, you would need to redefine the entire tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unit Consistency Check\n",
    "A common mistake in forecast evaluation is comparing \"Precipitation Rate\" (mm/day, kg/m2/s) with \"Total Accumulation\" (mm). Check your metadata to ensure the `unit_cvt_list` brings all models to a consistent **mm/day** or **mm/period** basis."

    "* **Data Alignment**: Ensure your NetCDF grid resolution is sufficient for your chosen boundary. If your region is very small (e.g., a small district) and your model resolution is coarse (e.g., 1 degree), you may end up with very few data points for analysis.\n",

    "1.  **Evaluation Period**: The specific days/years you are benchmarking the model's accuracy (e.g., 2013–2015).\n",
    "2.  **Climatological Period**: The years used to define \"normal\" rainfall. Usually, this is a much longer period (e.g., 30 years), but in the config template, it is matched to the evaluation years.\n",
    "3.  **years** and **years_clim** are optional. By default, a list of consecutive years are created according to **start_date / end_date** and **start_year_clim / end_year_clim**, but can be overiden by list of specific years (not necessary in consecutive order) as in **years** and **years_clim**. Set to `None` if not used in the package. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Initialization Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "Most S2S forecast models (like the IFS) do not run every day. They might only run twice a week.\n",
    "* **`init_days = (0, 3)`**: This tells the script to only look for forecast data initialized on **Mondays** and **Thursdays**.\n",
    "* **`date_filter_year`**: Because the date of a \"Monday\" changes every year, the system uses a reference year (e.g., 2024) to lock in the `MM/DD` combinations. For example, if May 6th was a Monday in 2024, the script will look for May 6th in 2013, 2014, and 2015 as an initialization candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations & Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Leap Years**: The system automatically handles February 29th, but ensure your `start_date` and `end_date` cover the full monsoon season (typically May through October for the Indian Monsoon).\n",

It determines how far into the future the model is tested and how much \"wiggle room\" (tolerance) is allowed for a forecast to be considered correct.

    "1.  **Verification Windows**: These are the \"Macro\" windows. You might want to see how the model performs in the first two weeks (`1, 15`) versus the second two weeks (`16, 30`). The model's skill is usually much higher in the first window.\n",
    "2.  **Day Bins**: These are the \"Micro\" windows for grouping **probabilistic forecast** statistics. They are used to group daily data into chunks (like 5-day intervals) for metric statistics and plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Tolerance Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The `tolerance_days_list` is critical for calculating \"Hit Rates.\" \n",
    "* A tolerance of **0** means the forecast must match the observation exactly.\n",
    "* A tolerance of **3** means if the observed onset is June 5th, any forecast between June 2nd and June 8th is considered a \"Hit.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints & Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Alignment**: The `max_forecast_day` must not exceed the actual length of your NetCDF forecast files. If your files only contain 15 days of data, setting this to 30 will cause the script to look for non-existent data.\n",
    "* **Overlap**: Ensure your `day_bins` fit within your `max_forecast_day`. For example, if `max_forecast_day` is 15, your bins shouldn't go up to 20.\n",

    "This section defines the statistical \"grading system\" for your models. It allows you to toggle specific performance metrics on or off depending on whether you are evaluating a single forecast (Deterministic) or a collection of forecasts (Probabilistic/Ensemble). The flags acts as toggle switches for the various statistical analyses the pipeline will perform. It is divided into two main categories: **Deterministic** (focused on error and accuracy) and **Probabilistic** (focused on uncertainty and reliability).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | Type | Description |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **FAR** | `Boolean` | **False Alarm Ratio**: How often the model predicted an onset that didn't happen. |\n",

    "| **MR** | `Boolean` | **Miss Rate**: How often the monsoon started but the model failed to predict it. |\n",

    "1.  **Deterministic Metrics (`probabilistic = False`)**:\n",
    "    Best for single-trajectory models (e.g., a single high-resolution run). These metrics measure the direct distance between the forecast date and the observed date.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Probabilistic Metrics (`probabilistic = True`)**:\n",
    "    Used when you have multiple versions of the same forecast (Ensembles). \n",
    "    * **Brier Score (BS)**: Measures the accuracy of probability forecasts.\n",
    "    * **Ranked Probability Score (RPS)**: Evaluates the entire probability distribution.\n",
    "    * **Reliability**: Generates data for Reliability Diagrams to see if the model is \"overconfident\" or \"underconfident.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuration Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Member List**: If `probabilistic = True`, the script looks for the specific member IDs listed in `members`. It can take a tuple of integers e.g., `(1, 5, 7, 9)`, a str specifying member ID range e.g., `\"1-5\"`. If set to `None` or `'All'` or `''`, the benchmark takes all members available in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Skill Scores**: Setting `skill_score = True` typically calculates how much better your forecast is compared to the `ref_model` defined in Section 3.\n",
    "\n",
